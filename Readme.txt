SVM_Mnist.py file contains the code to implement support vector machine and DeepNetwork.py consists of the code to implement Convolution neural network
Please follow the following steps to ensure the execution of the files:

1. Install python libraries/modules such as Scikit learn, Numpy, Tensorflow, Scipy

2. Code uses data file from the tensor flow library which will be imported in the code but you have to activate an environment with above written modules.

3. These are the only requirements to run the code. The tensorflow will run on the CPU and it will take approx 2 days to execute depending on your CPU. If you want to see the results you can comment the training part and the testing part will execute by importing the trained model from the files given along the code.
